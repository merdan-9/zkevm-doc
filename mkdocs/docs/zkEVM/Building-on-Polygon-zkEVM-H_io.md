## Introduction

Polygon zkEVM is a zero-knowledge scaling solution aiming at being **fully equivalent to the EVM**, and thus working seamlessly with existing smart contracts, developer toolings and wallets. It is therefore designed to provide a complete EVM-like experience for Users and Developers alike.

You don't need any special toolings or Wallets to build or interact with Polygon zkEVM.

Developers are able to deploy their existing contracts to the zkEVM, and Users can deposit assets from Ethereum and transact off-chain. These transactions are grouped into batches and backed by zero-knowledge proofs attesting to the validity of each transaction.




## How To Connect Your Wallet To zkEVM Testnet

In order to add the **Polygon zkEVM** network to your wallet, you will need to enter the following details:

- **Network Name**: Polygon zkEVM Testnet
- **RPC URL**: [https://rpc.public.zkevm-test.net](https://rpc.public.zkevm-test.net/)
- **Chain ID**: 1422
- **Currency Symbol**: ETH
- **Block Explorer URL**: [https://explorer.public.zkevm-test.net](https://explorer.public.zkevm-test.net/)


Also, for moving assets across chains, you will need to use the zkEVM Bridge. The bridge interface is available on https://public.zkevm-test.net/. 

For developers, the Bridge API is available at https://bridge-api.public.zkevm-test.net/.
