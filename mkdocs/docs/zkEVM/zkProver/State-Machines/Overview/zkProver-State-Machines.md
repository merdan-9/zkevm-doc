# zkProver State Machines - An Overview





Core to the integrity of the Polygon zkEVM is its zero-knowledge prover, dubbed the zkProver.

This document seeks to provide a more detailed architectural description of the zkProver without delving  deep into its technical complexities, as well as to introduce the zkProver's state machines in a cursory manner. It is therefore a prelude to the state machines' documentation. 





## Introduction



The design paradigm at Polygon Hermez has shifted to developing a zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkEVM) that emulates the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Proving and verification of transactions in Hermez 2.0 are all handled by a zero-knowledge prover-component dubbed the **zkProver**.

But before delving deep into the state machines, note that the zkProver is but a component in the Polygon Hermez zkEVM, and the only one responsible for proving.

In order to lay the context for the state machines, recall that the zkProver mainly interacts with two other components, the Node and the Database (DB).

<div align="center"><b> Figure 1: zkProver and the Node </b></div>



As depicted in Figure 1 above; 

Firstly, the Node sends the content of Merkle trees to the DB, to be stored there. 

Secondly, the Node sends the input transactions to the zkProver. 

Thirdly, the zkProver accesses the DB, fetching the information it needs to produce verifiable proofs of the transactions sent by the Node. This information consists of, among others, the Merkle roots, the keys and hashes of relevant siblings. 

Fourthly, the zkProver generates the proofs of transactions, and sends these proofs back to the Node. 

But this only scratches the surface of what the zkProver does. There is a lot more detail involved in how the zkProver actually creates these verifiable proofs of transactions. And, it is in these details that the state machines come into the picture.





## State Machines



The zkProver follows modularity of design to the extend that, except for a few components, it is mainly a cluster of state machines. It has a total of thirteen (13) state machines;

- The Main State Machine, 
- Secondary state machines; The Binary SM, The Storage SM, The Memory SM, The Arithmetic SM, The Keccak Function SM, The PoseidonG SM,
- Auxiliary state machines; The Padding-PG SM, The Padding-KK SM, The Bits2Field SM, The Memory Align SM, The Byte4 SM, The ROM SM.



The modular design of the zkProver allows the Main SM to delegate as many of its duties as possible to other specialist state machines. As such, efficiency is achieved through delegation.



### Secondary State Machines



The Main SM Executor directly instructs each of the secondary state machines by sending appropriate instructions called ***Actions***, as depicted in Figure 2 below.

The grey boxes are not state machines but indicate ***Actions***, which are specific instructions from the Main SM to the relevant secondary SM.

These instructions dictate how a state should transition in a state machine. However, every "Action", whether from the generic Main SM or the specific SM, must be supported with a proof that it was correctly executed.

There are some natural dependencies such as between; 

- the Storage State Machine which uses merkle Trees and the $\text{POSEIDON}$ State Machine, which is needed for computing hash values of all nodes in the Storage's Merkle Trees.
- Each of the hashing state machines, Keccak Function SM and the PoseidonG SM, and their respective padding state machines, the Padding-KK SM and the Padding-PG SM.





## Two Novel Languages For The zkProver



The Polygon Hermez team has created two novel languages especially for the zkProver; The Zero-Knowledge Assembly language and the Polynomial Identity Language. 

Since adopting the state machines paradigm means switching from highlevel programming to low-level programming, it is not suprising for the zkProve to employ an especially designed language for the firmware and another for the hardware.



### The Zero-Knowledge Assembly



As an Assembly language, the Zero-Knowledge Assembly (or zkASM) language is specially designed to map instructions from the zkProver's Main SM to other state machines. In the case of state machines with the firmware, zkASM is therefore the interpreter for the firmware. 

zkASM codes take instructions from the Main SM and generate prescriptive assembly codes for how the specific SM Executor has to execute computations. The Executor's strict adherence to the rules and logic of the zkASM codes, enables easy verification of computations.



### The Polynomial Identities Language 



The Polynomial Identity Language (or PIL) is especially designed for the zkProver, because almost all state machines express computations in terms of polynomials. State transitions in state machines must therefore satisfy computation-specific polynomial identities.

Recall that the aim of this project is creating the most effective solution to the Blockchain Trilemma; Privacy, Secure and Scalable. And its context is that of an efficient Zero-Knowledge Commitment Scheme. Since the most secure and efficient commitment schemes are the Polynomial Commitment Schemes, it was expedient to translate computations into some polynomial language, where verification boils down to testing whether execution satisfies certain polynomial identities.

All PIL codes, in the zkProver's state machines, therefore form the very DNA of the verifier code. 


These two languages, zkASM and PIL, were designed mindful of prospects for broader adoption outside Polygon zkEVM.





## The Micro-Processor Context



There are two micro-processor-type state machines; the Main SM and the Storage SM. This means these two SMs have the firmware part and the hardware part.

The firmware part runs the zkASM language to set up the logic and rules, which are expressed in JSON format and stored in a ROM. The JSON-file is then parsed to the specific SM Executor, which then executes Storage Actions in compliance with the rules and logic in the JSON-file.

The hardware part, which speaks the Polynomial Identity Language (PIL), defines constraints (or polynomial identities), expresses them in JSON format and stores them in the corresponding JSON-file. As in the firmware case, these constraints are also parsed to the specific SM Executor, because all computations must be executed in conformance to the polynomial identities.



![Figure 3 : Micro-Processor State Machine](figures/fig-micro-pro-pic.png)

<div align="center"><b> Figure 3 : Micro-Processor State Machine </b></div>



Although these two micro-processor SMs, the Main SM and the Storage SM, have the same look and feel, they differ considerably.

For instance, the Storage SM specialises with execution of Storage Actions (also called SMT Actions), whilst the Main SM is responsible for a wider range of Actions. Nevertheless the Main SM delegates most of these Actions to specialist state machines. And, of course, the Storage SM remains secondary in that it also receives instructions from the Main SM, and not conversely.

It is worth noting that each of these micro-processor SMs has its own ROM.





## Hashing In The zkProver



There are two secondary state machines specialising with hashing; The Keccak State Machine and the $\text{POSEIDON}$ State Machine, where each is an 'automised' version of its standard cryptographic hash function.



### The Keccak State Machine



The deployment of the Keccak hash function is not surprising given the fact that it is deployed in Ethereum, and Polygon Hermez is a zk-rollup, an L2 scaling solution for Ethereum.

The Keccak state machine is a gates state machine, and thus has a set of logic gates (the hardware) and a set of connections between the gates (the logic). It is a secondary state machine composed of the Keccak SM Hash Generator and the Keccak PIL code, where the latter is for validation purposes.

A full description of the Keccak SM can be found in its individual document.



### The POSEIDON State Machine



The $\text{POSEIDON}$ hash function, although newer than the Keccak hash and thus still under the scrutiny of cryptanalysts, it has been publicised as a [zk-STARK-friendly hash function](https://starkware.co/hash-challenge/). As such, it is best-suited for the zkProver context.

The $\text{POSEIDON}$ SM is the most straight forward especially if one is familiar with the internal mechanism of the original Poseidon hash function. 

The hash function's permutation process translates readily to the state transitions of the $\text{POSEIDON}$ State Machine. The hash function's twelve (12) input elements, the non-linear substitution layers (the S-boxes) and the linear diffusion layers (the MDS matrices), are directly implemented in the state machine.   

Although a secondary state machine, the $\text{POSEIDON}$ SM receives instructions from both the Main SM and the Storage SM.

The $\text{POSEIDON}$ SM has the executor part and an internal PIL code, which is a set of verification rules, written in the PIL language.

A full description of the $\text{POSEIDON}$ SM can be found in its individual document.





## Basic Approach To Proving Execution-Correctness



What follows is an outline of the basic approach to proving that computations were correctly executed in each state machine.

The zkProver's state machines are designed to execute programs, as well as to guarantee that these programs are correctly executed.

Each secondary state machine therefore consists of its own executor and a PIL program that can be used to check correct execution of all the instructions coming from the Main SM Executor.

Here is a step-by-step outline of how the system achieves proof/verification of transactions,

- Represent a given computation as a state machine (SM),
- Express the state changes of the SM as polynomials,
- Capture traces of state changes, called execution traces, as rows of a lookup table, 
- Form polynomial identities/constraints that these state transitions satisfy, 
- 'Prover' uses a specific polynomial commitment scheme to commit and prove knowledge of the committed polynomials,
- [Plookup](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/315.pdf) is one of the ways to check if the Prover's commited polynomials produce correct traces.

While the polynomial constraints are written in the PIL language, the instructions are initially written in zk-assembly but subsequently expressed and stored in JSON format.

The above outline of the proof/verification procedure was explained in this [blogpost](https://blog.hermez.io/zkevm-documentation/), and further detailed in the documentation [here](https://docs.hermez.io/zkEVM/Basic-Concepts/simple-state-machine/).

Although not all verification involves a Plookup, the diagram below, briefly illustrates the wide role Plookup plays in the zkProver.

## Main Components Of The zkProver




For the sake of simplicity, one can think of the zkProver as being composed of the following four components; 

1. The Executor, which is the Main State Machine Executor
2. The STARK Recursion Component
3. The CIRCOM Library
4. The zk-SNARK Prover



In the nutshell, the zkProver uses these four components to generates verifiable proofs. Figure 5 below surmises the process. 





### The Executor



The Executor is in fact the Main SM Executor. It takes as inputs; the transactions, the old and the new states, the ChainID of the Sequencer, to mention a few.

The executor also needs; 

1. The PIL, which is the list of polynomials, the list of the registers, and
2. The ROM, which stores the list of instructions pertaining to execution.

So, with these inputs, the Executor executes all instructions on top of the PIL hardware and generates the committed polynomials; which are the state machine cycles, or a list of all the states. It also generates some public data,which forms part of the input to the zk-SNARK verifier.

A full description of the Executor can be found in the Main State Machine's individual document.





### The STARK Recursion Component



Once the Main SM Executor has converted transactions and related data to committed polynomials, the STARK Recursion Component takes as inputs;

1. The Committed Polynomials,
2. The Constant Polynomials,
3. Scripts, which are lists of instructions,

in order to generate a zk-STARK proof.

In an effort to facilitate fast zk-STARK proving, the STARK Recursion Component utilises Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proofs of Proximity (RS-IOPP), also referred to as FRI, for each zk-proof.

The component is referred to as the STARK Recursion, because; 

(a) It actually produces several zk-STARK proofs, 

(b) Collates them into bundles of a few zk-STARK proofs, 

(c) And produces a further zk-STARK proof of each bundle,

(d) The resulting zk-STARK proofs of the bundle are also collated and proved with only one zk-STARK proof.

This way, hundreds of zk-STARK proofs are represented and proved with only one zk-STARK proof.





### The CIRCOM Library



The single zk-STARK proof produced by the STARK Recursion Component is the input to a CIRCOM component.

CIRCOM is a [circuits library](https://github.com/socathie/circomlib-ml) used in the zkProver to generate the *witness* for the zk-STARK proof produced by the STARK Recursion Component.

The original CIRCOM [paper](https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/CIRCOM_A_Robust_and_Scalable_Language_for_Building_Complex_Zero-Knowledge_Circuits/19374986/1) describes it as both a circuits programming language to define Arithmetic circuits, and a compiler that generates, 

1. A file containing a set of associated Rank-1 Constraints System (R1CS) constraints, and 
2. A program (written either in C++ or WebAssembly) to efficiently compute a valid assignment to all wires of the Arithmetic circuit.

Arithmetic circuits are mostly used as standard models for studying the complexity of computations involving polynomials.

That being said, the CIRCOM component takes as inputs; the zk-STARK proof from the STARK Recursion Component and the Verifier Data; in order to produce a *witness*. This witness is in fact an Arithmetic circuit expressed in terms of its R1CS constraints.  





### The zk-SNARK Prover



The last component of the zkProver is the zk-SNARK Prover, in particular, Rapid SNARK. 

Rapid SNARK is a zk-SNARK proof generator, written in C++ and intel assembly, which is very fast in generating proofs of CIRCOM's outputs.

With regards to the zkProver, the Rapid SNARK takes as inputs 

1. The witness from CIRCOM, and 
2. The STARK verifier data, which dictates how the Rapid SNARK must process the data, 

and then generate a zk-SNARK proof.

#### A Strategy To Achieving Succinctness

zk-STARK proofs are used because of their speed, and they require no trusted setup. They are however a lot more sizable compared to zk-SNARK proofs. It is for this reason, and the succinctness of the zk-SNARKs, that the zkProver uses a zk-SNARK to attest to the correctness of the zk-STARK proofs. zk-SNARKs are therefore published as the validity proofs to state changes. This strategy has huge benefits as it results in gas costs reducing from 5M to 350K.
